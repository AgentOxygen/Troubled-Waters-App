# Development v0.0.1
Version semantics:
1. A difference from 0.0.0 to 0.0.1 indicates a patch to fix bugs or issues
2. A difference from 0.0.0 to 0.1.0 indicates a new feature or change that doesn't require old features to change.
3. A difference from 0.0.0 to 1.0.0 indicates a rework of core code or the overall system that makes old features incompatable.

In cases 1-2, code will likely be deprecated as opposed to removed to maintain compatability. Deprecated code will be removed with a major update (case 3).
